   <p>
    Getting marrow from backside with needle
    <p>
     Insert injection needle in arm for later
     <p>
      Marrow goes to lab

      <p>

         Inject via injection needle in arm
         <li>
          Need to be low stress for it, brand new baby cells

         "Permanent" boost of stem cells
         <ul>
          <li>
           Makes a miscellaneous cell - will die off
           <li>
            Makes a stem cell
            <ul>
             <li>
              lives forever unless killed (drugs, bad lifestyle, etc.)

              </li>

             <ul>
              <li>
               Felt "little worms" in her body
               <li>
                They will go where they are needed most (cancer, immune system, repairing anything that needs it)
                <li>
                 Once they find where to go, they have to ingraft
                 <ul>
                  <li>

          <ul>
           <li>
            After 7 days it's okay to do other things again
           </li>

   Mouth
  </h2>
  <p>
   You are what you eat
   <p>
    Brush your gums
    <p>
     Quickest way to bloodstream
     <ul>
      <li>
       IV, then under the tongue
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Blood thinner under tongue for migraines? Good thing?
      <p>
       Important to consider what's going to the bloodstream
       <p>
        Toothpaste
        <ul>
         <li>
          By law have "Warnings: keep out of reach of children...accidentally swallowed...poison..."
          <li>
           Warnings is plural because there are more of them, hard to find
           <li>
            For several minutes of day (2-3 minutes, 2-3 x per day), all the poisons in toothpaste are absorbing... and entering bloodstream quickly
            <ul>
             <li>
              Chemical that makes toothpaste burn was added to create a habit
              <ul>
               <li>
                associate burning with "it's working", therefore do it more
               </li>
              </ul>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
             Dentists whiten by stripping enamel
             <li>
              What to use
              <ul>
               <li>
                Beware Tom's (flouride, sodium laurel sulfate)
                <li>
                 clean with baking soda (neutral, doesn't hurt enamel)
                 <li>
                  rinse with hydrogen peroxide (doesn't need to be food grade since you're not swallowing)
                  <li>
                   white with baking soda &amp; lemon paste (baking soda neutralizes the lemon acid)
                   <ul>
                    <li>
                     pack paste onto teeth, 3-5 minutes
                     <li>
                      will drool a lot
                     </li>
                    </li>
                   </ul>
                  </li>
                 </li>
                </li>
               </li>
              </ul>
             </li>
            </li>
           </li>

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         careful with "no added hormones"
         <ul>
          <li>
           Dr. Branyon bought chicken breast at Whole Foods
           <li>
            had an instinct in her gut she listened to
            <li>
             banner with no added hormones, no added antibiotics
             <li>
              chicken breasts were plumped (sign of hormones, should normally be flat)
              <li>
               woke up in the middle of the night and googled "no added hormones"
               <ul>
                <li>
                 means: the farmer who used hormones and antibiotics sent it to slaughter, whole foods buys it from packaging plant. Whole foods didn't "add" hormones.
                 <li>
                  you can't add hormones to dead meat
                 </li>
                </li>
               </ul>
              </li>
             </li>
            </li>
           </li>
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Mercury Fillings (amalgams)
          <ul>
           <li>
            made of 5 heavy metals: mercury, silver, nickle, tin, cadmium
            <li>
             if old or cracked, filling will gas out
             <li>
              get to dentist if metal taste in your mouth (trouble!)
              <li>
               can cause head and neck cancer, alzheimer's, parkinson's
               <li>
                remove them and get resin or porcelain
                <li>
                 Jaddi and Maggie could give recommendations of where to go
                </li>
               </li>
              </li>

           Root Canals
           <ul>
            <li>
             Recently started changing how they do it. might be good
             <li>
              Old way
              <ul>
               <li>
                front teeth have 1 nerve, side has 2, back have 3
                <li>
                 grind down tooth, leaving just a little above gums
                 <li>
                  strip old nerves out, canals left empty
                  <li>
                   clean up with calcium oxelate
                   <li>
                    put metal rods in canal
                    <li>
                     cap with a new pretty tooth and glue it to old tooth
                    </li>
                   </li>
                  </li>

               </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
               the canals fill with bacteria that the body has to fight all the time... because it's warm and moist
               <ul>
                <li>
                 get it taken care of:
                 <ul>
                  <li>
                   immune system can focus on other things
                   <li>
                    mouth infections can lead to problems in brain
                   </li>
                  </li>
                 </ul>
                </li>
               </ul>
               <li>
                Dr. Branyon had hers pulled
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  didn't do implants
                  <li>
                   seems to be correlation between stomach cancers and implants
                   <li>
                    Implants:
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                      pull tooth
                      <li>
                       screw tooth into bone with titanium screw (not good to get in blood stream)
                      </li>
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>
                     can do a bridge, maybe the new root canal (probably way expensive)
                    </li>
                   </li>
                  </li>

    <li>

     <li>
      Deep-seated need to make others happy, tending to be a "people-pleaser" - great need for approval

       </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
       History of lack of closeness wit spouse or others who would normally be close
       <ul>
        <li>
         No perfect marriages/relationships
         <li>
          The problems are with harboring resentment
          <li>
           It's all about attitude
           <ul>
            <li>
             Dr. Issels: "If you don't like your wife, divorce her! (footstomp)...If you don't like your job, etc..."
             <li>
              Change your attitude and then address remaining problems in your life
              <li>
               "Change the way we look at things (and the way things look will change?)"

        </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Long-standing suppression of toxic emotions, such as anger, resentment and/or hostility. Typically... cancer patients internalize such emotions
        <ul>
         <li>
          "Why didn't I say...?" when people offend us. Not good for immune system.
         </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
         React adversely to stress, often being unable to cope adequately with such stress, usually an... especially traumatic event around two years before the onset of cancer.

               <li>
                Use non-dominant hand to answer it
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  working against your consciousness, distracts it and allows your subconsciousness to come out and answer

   ATTRIBUTES OF CANCER SURVIVORS
  </h1>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Willing and able to reverse life-style; reduce heavy obligations, burdens and anxieties. Learning to "say no"... to those who would lay burdens upon them.
    <li>
     Aware of the importance of spiritual growth and acquiescence to the authority and benevolence of God... or their concept of a Higher Power.
     <li>
      Ready and eager to take charge of their own health care, to study the various alternatives, to make dietary... and other changes in their physical lifestyle.
      <li>
       Able to reject the idea that a diagnosis of cancer automatically means death and that conventional therapy... offers the only hope.
       <ul>
        <li>
         Previous patient Rudy had abdominal pain. GP sent him to surgeon, did exploratory lab.
         <li>
          Pancreatic cancer, 2 months or less to live.
          <li>
           Family made him come to New Hope. He grudgingly did. Kept getting worse.
           <li>
            Dr. Branyon had inspired idea that problem was botched surgery.
            <li>
             They checked it out; wasn't pancreatic cancer.
             <li>
              Rudy was told he had it, he was devastated.
              <li>
               New Hope could not convince him he didn't have it.
               <li>
                He died. Autopsy showed no cancer.
                <li>
                 Moral: What we think can be devastating or healing.

        <ul>
         <li>
          90% or more of cancers are not hereditary. Need to look at causing factors.
          <li>

            Electric blankets (don't use while they're on)

             <li>

        </ul>
        <li>
