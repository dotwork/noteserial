DIET

Life is an illusion
    Knowledge, learning, positive thoughts and things
        exercising thought patterns helps immune system
    "You are today what you thought you were yesterday, therefore you will be tomorrow what you think you are today"
    Doctors used to look at:
        coloring (liver problems, etc.)
        hands, nails ("moons"...the part at base of nail...on fingers other than thumbs indicate thyroid function, or how well immune system is functioning.)
            get better sleep, better diet, lower stress, take vitamins (moons come back)
        diagonal crease (doesn't work as well on women due to pierced ears)
            need to be checked out for atherrosclerosis (hardening of arteries)

GUEST SPEAKER

Nigel Lyons from Sedona, Arizona

Positive attitude
    got everyone dancing at the pub:
        "that's how easy you can change life"
    "this crap really works"
    "(can't be) tigger everyday"
    "it's worth it, even if you don't get better"

MONDAY LECTURE 8/1/2016

Wednesday Bone Marrow
    Going under for surgery (asleep but not deep) for about 45 minutes (procedure takes 5)
    Getting marrow from backside with needle
    Insert injection needle in arm for later
    Marrow goes to lab
        Cells are still living
        Incubate it with growth factor
        Count stem cells with microscope (up to 800 million cells)
    In the afternoon
        Inject via injection needle in arm
        Need to be low stress for it, brand new baby cells
    General Stubblebine
        Cells remember/connected to host (pee & motorcycle stories)
        Cells live on
    "Permanent" boost of stem cells
        Makes a miscellaneous cell - will die off
        Makes a stem cell
            lives forever unless killed (drugs, bad lifestyle, etc.)
            will divide again
        Dr. Branyon doesn't think it takes 7 days for cells to settle in to place
            Felt "little worms" in her body
            They will go where they are needed most (cancer, immune system, repairing anything that needs it)
            Once they find where to go, they have to ingraft
                Can take up to 2 months to get fully settled in, mature, and start replicating
    Won't do laetrile after this. Too strong for the stem cells.
        After 7 days it's okay to do other things again

Mouth
    You are what you eat
    Brush your gums
    Quickest way to bloodstream
        IV, then under the tongue
    Blood thinner under tongue for migraines? Good thing?
    Important to consider what's going to the bloodstream
    Toothpaste
        By law have "Warnings: keep out of reach of children...accidentally swallowed...poison..."
        Warnings is plural because there are more of them, hard to find
        For several minutes of day (2-3 minutes, 2-3 x per day), all the poisons in toothpaste are absorbing... and entering bloodstream quickly
            Chemical that makes toothpaste burn was added to create a habit
                associate burning with "it's working", therefore do it more
        Dentists whiten by stripping enamel
        What to use
            Beware Tom's (flouride, sodium laurel sulfate)
            clean with baking soda (neutral, doesn't hurt enamel)
            rinse with hydrogen peroxide (doesn't need to be food grade since you're not swallowing)
            white with baking soda & lemon paste (baking soda neutralizes the lemon acid)
                pack paste onto teeth, 3-5 minutes
                will drool a lot
    careful with "no added hormones"
        Dr. Branyon bought chicken breast at Whole Foods
        had an instinct in her gut she listened to
        banner with no added hormones, no added antibiotics
        chicken breasts were plumped (sign of hormones, should normally be flat)
        woke up in the middle of the night and googled "no added hormones"
            means: the farmer who used hormones and antibiotics sent it to slaughter, whole foods buys it from packaging plant. Whole foods didn't "add" hormones.
            you can't add hormones to dead meat
    Mercury Fillings (amalgams)
        made of 5 heavy metals: mercury, silver, nickle, tin, cadmium
        if old or cracked, filling will gas out
        get to dentist if metal taste in your mouth (trouble!)
        can cause head and neck cancer, alzheimer's, parkinson's
        remove them and get resin or porcelain
        Jaddi and Maggie could give recommendations of where to go
    Root Canals
        Recently started changing how they do it. might be good
        Old way
            front teeth have 1 nerve, side has 2, back have 3
            grind down tooth, leaving just a little above gums
            strip old nerves out, canals left empty
            clean up with calcium oxelate
            put metal rods in canal
            cap with a new pretty tooth and glue it to old tooth
        the canals fill with bacteria that the body has to fight all the time... because it's warm and moist
            get it taken care of:
                immune system can focus on other things
                mouth infections can lead to problems in brain
        Dr. Branyon had hers pulled
            didn't do implants
            seems to be correlation between stomach cancers and implants
            Implants:
                pull tooth
                screw tooth into bone with titanium screw (not good to get in blood stream)
            can do a bridge, maybe the new root canal (probably way expensive)
    Teeth & Emotions (Chinese medicine)
        for every tooth, there is an emotion attached
        see handouts

Antineoplastons
    Urine therapy: angioplasties are made from patient's urine
    Your Own Perfect Medicine
    In the waste is important hormones and antibodies
        it's like your own private vaccine
    Can't do it if you're on heavy narcotics
    Body will filter things correctly to get the good and pass the bad
    Inject it into muscle with a syringe with a filter

Near vs far infrared therapy
    Recommend far infrared because it gets deeper
        be careful with cedar, it gasses out
    $400 for dome-shaped far-infrared
    If doing the bag kind, check the material to make sure it's safe
    Near infrared doesn't get deep into the body

ELLAGIC ACID

Induces cervical carcinoma cell death (apoptosis) within 72 hours

Found in
    raspberries
    strawberries
    pomegranates
    blackberries
    pecans
    walnuts

MONDAY LECTURE 8/3/2016

THE CANCER PERSONALITY
    # Highly conscientious, dutiful, responsible, caring, hard-working, usually of above average intelligence
    # Strong tendency toward carrying other people's burdens and taking on extra obligations
    # Deep-seated need to make others happy, tending to be a "people-pleaser" - great need for approval
        Impossible to please people
    # History of lack of closeness wit spouse or others who would normally be close
        No perfect marriages/relationships
        The problems are with harboring resentment
        It's all about attitude
            Dr. Issels: "If you don't like your wife, divorce her! (footstomp)...If you don't like your job, etc..."
            Change your attitude and then address remaining problems in your life
            "Change the way we look at things (and the way things look will change?)"
    # Long-standing suppression of toxic emotions, such as anger, resentment and/or hostility. Typically... cancer patients internalize such emotions
        "Why didn't I say...?" when people offend us. Not good for immune system.
    # React adversely to stress, often being unable to cope adequately with such stress, usually an... especially traumatic event around two years before the onset of cancer.
        Asian medical philosophy: for every emotion there's an organ attached
        Need to let go of grief, sadness, guilt, etc.
        Consciousness and subconsciousness
            On paper, ask question such as "Why can't I get over this?" with dominant hand
            Use non-dominant hand to answer it
                working against your consciousness, distracts it and allows your subconsciousness to come out and answer
    # Inability to verbalize or resolve deep-seated problems, conflicts, and burdens.
        Need to work at things mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically

ATTRIBUTES OF CANCER SURVIVORS
    # Willing and able to reverse life-style; reduce heavy obligations, burdens and anxieties. Learning to "say no"... to those who would lay burdens upon them.
    # Aware of the importance of spiritual growth and acquiescence to the authority and benevolence of God... or their concept of a Higher Power.
    # Ready and eager to take charge of their own health care, to study the various alternatives, to make dietary... and other changes in their physical lifestyle.
    # Able to reject the idea that a diagnosis of cancer automatically means death and that conventional therapy... offers the only hope.
        Previous patient Rudy had abdominal pain. GP sent him to surgeon, did exploratory lab.
        Pancreatic cancer, 2 months or less to live.
        Family made him come to New Hope. He grudgingly did. Kept getting worse.
        Dr. Branyon had inspired idea that problem was botched surgery.
        They checked it out; wasn't pancreatic cancer.
        Rudy was told he had it, he was devastated.
        New Hope could not convince him he didn't have it.
        He died. Autopsy showed no cancer.
        Moral: What we think can be devastating or healing.
    # Prepared to accept responsibility for behavioral factors which led to the disease, submit to self-assessment,... and to make the necessary corrections and alterations of those factors.
        90% or more of cancers are not hereditary. Need to look at causing factors.
        Nearby radio towers?
        Electric blankets (don't use while they're on)
        Smoking (New Hope sent home patient who wouldn't try to decrease his smoking habit)
        When pumping gas, don't stand close to the fumes and smell it
        Look for everywhere in your life you can change something
    # Willing to abandon destructive and "toxic" emotions such as fear, anger, resentment, self-pity, and guilt,... replacing the positive emotions such as hope, love, forgiveness, confidence, and faith.
    # Able to overcome inhibitions and learned restraints which may have prevented full sexual gratification,... allowing guiltless and total fulfillment with a loving partner.

QUESTIONS

Live Cell Therapy
    How does it work?
    What does it do?
    Thymus goes into sublingual receptors, migrate to thymus and generate new cells for thymus
    Shark Cartilege: live cell, cuts off blood supply to cancer cells
        Health food store version is too big
        Buy with "liposomes", absorbs better

Sodium Bicarbonate IV
    First one is Sodium Bicarbonate (makes you overly alkaline)
    Second one is Calcium, magnesium (electrolytes, brings you back into balance)

THURSDAY LECTURE 8/4/2016

SUPPLEMENTS
    Put on backburner
        Vitamin D
        Multi-vitamin
            New Hope's doesn't have iron
            (Why? What about copper pipes?)
    Be careful of brand with supplements
        Don't buy cheapest
        Can have a lot of fillers, even more dangerous if taking multiple
    Water-soluble Vitamins (B's, C's, etc.)
        Body uses what it needs at that time, then you sweat/urine it out
    Fat-soluble Vitamins (Vitamin D)
        If you have too  much, you store it, usually in liver
        liver enzymes go up, could cause liver-failure due to toxicity
        Be careful with vitamin D. Do with blood work every other month
        Better to get vitamin D from the sun
            10 minutes a day
            Pineal gland (behind forehead) works better with sun-exposure
                helps immune system
                at dark, cortisol levels will encourage you to sleep
    Supplements provided by New Hope
        EPDHEA (Omega 3's)
        Nutrient 915 (multi without iron)
        Beta 1-3 Glucan
            Fights cancer cell by eating outside membrane and then helps on the inside once it gets there
        Microcyclin
            Mix of mushrooms
        Enzymes
            # Pancreatin 8x Plus
                take with meals
                helps digest food
            # Wobenzym
                take between meals
                helps to eat away tumor and digest dead tumor cells
                New Hope used to get it from Germany
                Germany does 18 capsules, 3x a day
                    Can build up to that many
                Is most expensive supplement in the pack
                    Buy/use more if you can
                    The "Empower" from Whole Foods would be better place to put money
        Melatonin
            Not a sleeping pill (that's a misconeption)
            Is for fighting tumor
            Can be dangerous if taken during the day
            Take it correctly
                at night, sun completely down
                can cause pituitary tumors
        Probiotics
    * Nancy will send price list for us to compare, but... if you find it cheaper, go for it
    * a lot of cancers look like chicken fat
    Supplements not provided by New Hope
        Thymus
            New Hope is not sending it
            Allergy Resource is good place to get capsule of it
                has preservatives (necessary in capsule form)
        Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC)
            Available in Japan for cheap
            In US:
                Douglas Labs: $500+ for 30 capsules
                Whole Foods: Biosciences - Empower (has AHCC in it)
                    $59 per bottle
        Turmeric (Curcumin)
            Double or triple the recommended dosage for cancer or if sick
            Check Indian/Greek grocery stores (Asian grocery stores?)
            Organic is not as big a deal since turmeric is not typically grown in the states
        Redoxon forte(sp?)
            don't take on same day as Vitamin C Drip
            1 a day
            2 grams vitamin c
            Has sugar, not good for healthy people in general (1 might be okay)
            For cancer patients, the sugar helps carry the vitamin c to the cancer cells

Vaccine
    Takes 3 weeks to make vaccine
        Cold centrifuge spins super fast and separates into several sections
            white blood cells
            buffy coat (strictly stem cells)
            red blood cells
        Carefully removes all but red blood cells (trashes red)
        Makes vaccine from white blood cells and buffy coat
        All natural, no preservatives, just antibodies
    Cancer cells have surface antigens
        Antibodies fight antigens
        Probably not making enough antibodies
    Shipping
        Will call to confirm we will be home before shipping
        Luis will pack it up with syringes, needles, alcohol wipes, etc.
        32 bottles of vaccine
        Sent overnight with ice packs (should last 3 days)
        Do not let it sit outside...check all day and get it inside quick!
    When you receive package
        Count all 32 bottles
        Make sure your name is on every label
        Put them in baggie in bottom of fridge in vegetable bin
        Will say "peptides" or something on the label
        Call Carol. She will walk you through it
        Will also have written instructions
    Taking it
        # Wash hands
        # Take 1 out, let it sit for 10 minutes (unless house is not air conditioned)
        # Clean surface you're using really well
        # Lay down clean paper towel
        # Take out a needle, alcohol-prep, syringe
        # Wash hands again, don't need gloves
        # Every bottle is pressurized with metal top. Pop it off with fingernail
            Has a bulls-eye on top
        # Open syringe at end with arrows
        # Has cap on it to protect it (in case you drop it, still sterile as long as needle doesn't touch anything)
        # Take cap off, twist needle off
        # Open alcohol wipe and wipe cap with bulls-eye
        # Pull syringe-plunger down to ___?
        # Insert needle into bottle:
            # rest syringe on palm to help guide it in
            # push needle in to the liquid
            # push plunger in to push air in until liquid gets to top of syringe
            # When you release plunger it will fill itself to a point
            # pull down plunger slowly
            # keep needle in the liquid and draw it down with the liquid
            # get every bit you can get
            # don't get air
            # slowly push plunger to push air out of syringe
            # flick syringe to get little air bubbles up to top
        # Replace needle
            open partially, slowly/carefully on side with arrows (side with head, not sharp point)
            don't touch the parts that connect
            hold syringe and wrapper of needle while connecting them
        # Inject into leg
            # make sure there are no veins where you inject
            # inject high up on leg (any side)
            # don't use lidocaine or any other ointment/medication on injection site
            # rub site with alcohol wipe
            # pinch skin up if you want to
            # layers
                skin > fat > muscle
                don't inject at 90 degree angle (straight in)
                go in at angle (about 45 degrees) from any direction into fat, not muscle
            # expect a bump because you're injecting fluid
            # expect redness, feverishness (histamine effect due to mass of antibodies, stimulates immune system)
            # if you get a blister, it went into skin
            # do every 4 days (on the 4th day after the day taken):
                if Tuesday, do again on Saturday, then Wednesday
            # switch legs each time

Home is different now
    Because your attitude is different
    Starts a brand new life, not going home to old ways
    Set new habits
    Hang out at home in joy, hope, confidence, etc.
    You are very special

Lionel the Pharmacist
    Vitamin C (about $6.50 per box)

Vitamin C Drips
    L rotation or D rotation vitamin c?
        D rotation is good, but dangerous in high dose
        L is better, the one proven to kill cancer
        3 a week of 75 or 100 grams

Testing Vitamin/mineral levels
    Doctor's Data (in Chicago?)
        Do hair analysis, etc.

Daily habits to employ
    low daily foot bath
    low daily infrared
    good sleep
    good food
    low stress

Next week or two be very careful what you eat

Remission means
    10 years ago - no cancer detectable. cured within 5 years if it doesn't come back
    Now - means it's not growing

Blood work
    Do once a month starting in 3-4 months

Miscellaneous notes
    Rebounders
    Sleep
        Deep sleep allows you to get rid of stress
        At least 9 hours when fighting illness
        No TV while you sleep (or at least set a sleep timer)
        Sun will wake you up (camping, open windows) due to cortisol response to it
    Water filtration
        Canaan machine is good but don't over-do the alkalinity
        Reverse osmosis is good (test it for crud ppm (parts-per-million))
    Don't restrict food until you're malnourished
        eat a clean, organic diet
    Infrared Dome is best place to put money
    Vinegar is an acid
        Don't do ACV right now (while cancer)
        Use lemon juice instead of vinegar
    Lavender is a good anti-inflammatory

For Steph:
    Apply topically (or with tampon):
        CBD
        baking soda and water paste
        castor oil
        miclocycline (mushroom stuff from New Hope)
